TODO:
- Add node id to the constructor, and then use it when packaging the heartbeat message (and possibly others)
- Bring duplicate can stuf in primary and secondary controls into core controls (only what will be permanent, not the temporary testing portions)
- Add framework for showing beep codes via LED
  - Setting error code via enum class causes a specific blink pattern
